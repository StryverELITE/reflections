1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	git init = creates .git folder to hold information about past versions of the directory

	it is needed for development in cases where previous versions may help track down "bugs"

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area is where changes are made. Working directory is where current position is. 

	Staging is valuable because it contains changes without affecting the working area.
